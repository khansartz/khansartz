# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Khansa Maritza A**, an Informatics Engineering student with a passion for data, AI, and all things tech. <br>

My journey started with front-end development, but I soon found myself drawn to the world of data analysis and machine learning. Now, Iâ€™m diving deep into AI/ML, sharpening my skills in Python, data science, and model development. <br>

I love solving problems, finding patterns in data, and building cool stuff that makes an impact. Whether it's optimizing workflows with data-driven decisions or experimenting with AI models, Iâ€™m always up for a challenge. Currently, Iâ€™m working on expanding my knowledge in AI/ML engineering, one project at a time. <br>
